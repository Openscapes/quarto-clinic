title: Explore
---

With this tutorial, we have a working example website that we will explore together. We'll learn a few rules and look for patterns to get an understanding of what things to do to help you start customizing and making it your own. And you can continue to use this website as a reference after the tutorial, along with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documentation.

We'll start our exploration online looking at the website architecture and GitHub repository. Then we'll setup a copy for ourselves so that we can modify from a working example, which is a great way to learn something new. We'll set it up so that any modifications (commits) will automatically be republished via GitHub Actions. Subsequent chapters will describe how to modify your repo using different tools (browser, RStudio, Jupyter).

## Exploring online

### The website itself

[This website](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-clinic/) has 5 things you can see on the left sidebar:

-   Welcome
-   Explore
-   Quarto workflows
-   GitHub workflows
-   Where to contribute

Most of these are pages, but you'll see that "Workflows" has an arrow `>`; it is a folder with additional pages inside.

### The website's repo

Let's go to this website's GitHub repository (also called a "repo"), <https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-clinic>. You can also click there from any page in this tutorial website by clicking the GitHub octocat icon underneath the Openscapes logo in the left navbar (click it holding command on Mac, or control on a PC to open it in a different tab in your browser).

**Have a look at the filenames.** We can recognize the names of the webpages we've seen above, and they have red arrows marking them in the image below. You'll see the "quarto-workflows" folder and the rest in this site are `.qmd` files, which are plain text Quarto files that can combine Markdown text with code. `index.qmd` is the home page. If you click inside "quarto-workflows" you'll see a mix of filetypes!

**The `_site` folder** has html files with names that should be familiar: they match the `.qmd` files we were just exploring. This folder is where Quarto stores files to build the website.

## `_quarto.yml` intro

There is also a `_quarto.yml` file, which is the website's configuration file. It is essentially metadata for the website that includes the order that the pages/chapters will be in. This is where you update the organization of your website: which page comes before another. If we compare side-by-side, you'll see that the pages that appear on our website are listed there.

We'll learn more about how to interact with `_quarto.yml` in [Quarto Workflows](workflows/index.qmd).

## Onward!

Now you are ready to start editing! The next chapter describes how to do this in the JupyterHub.
