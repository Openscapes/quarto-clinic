TODO: Do Setup after Welcome, then do Explore while Hub is initiating. Setup includes Hub login, clone, branch. Preview site is step 1 in Lessons: Edit Quarto site.

## Setup Part 1: Log in to the Hub

Go to the Hub https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud \> log in with your GitHub Account \> select the Python server.

It takes a few minutes for the Hub to load. Please be patient!

While the server starts up, weâ€™ll explore the GitHub Clinic website structure side by side with the repo.

## Explore

With this Clinic, we have a working example website that we will explore together. We'll learn a few rules and look for patterns to get an understanding of what things to do to help you start customizing and making it your own. And you can continue to use this website as a reference after the clinic, along with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documentation.

We'll start our exploration online looking at the website architecture and GitHub repository. Then we'll setup a copy for ourselves so that we can modify from a working example, which is a great way to learn something new. We'll set it up so that any modifications (commits) will automatically be republished via GitHub Actions.

### The website itself

[This Quarto Clinic website](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-clinic/) has 4 things you can see on the left sidebar:

-   Welcome
-   Setup & Explore
-   Lessons
-   Next Steps

Most of these are pages, but you'll see that "Lessons" has an arrow `>`; it is a folder with additional pages inside.

### The website's source repo

Let's go to this website's GitHub repository (also called a "repo"), <https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-clinic>. You can also click there from any page in this tutorial website by clicking the GitHub octocat icon underneath the Openscapes logo in the left navbar (click it holding command on Mac, or control on a PC to open it in a different tab in your browser).

**Have a look at the filenames.** We can recognize the names of the webpages we've seen above, and they have red arrows marking them in the image below. You'll see the "quarto-workflows" folder and the rest in this site are `.qmd` files, which are plain text Quarto files that can combine Markdown text with code. `index.qmd` is the home page. If you click inside "quarto-workflows" you'll see a mix of filetypes!

*TODO: replace screenshots*

**The `_site` folder** has html files with names that should be familiar: they match the `.qmd` files we were just exploring. This folder is where Quarto stores files to build the website.

### `_quarto.yml` intro

There is also a `_quarto.yml` file, which is the website's configuration file. It is essentially metadata for the website that includes the order that the pages/chapters will be in. This is where you update the organization of your website: which page comes before another. If we compare side-by-side, you'll see that the pages that appear on our website are listed there.

![\_quarto.yml and website side-by-side](images/quarto-yml-site-side-by-side3.png){fig-align="center"}

We'll learn more about how to interact with `_quarto.yml` in the [Lessons](lessons/index.qmd).

## Setup Part 2: Clone the Quarto Clinic repo

After our Hub server is loaded, we'll clone the Quarto Clinic repository into the Hub.

**Option A:** Use the Git tab to Clone repo

![Clone a GitHub repository in the Hub](images/jupyterhyb-clone-repo.png)

**Option B:** Do this by opening a terminal (File \> New \> Terminal). In the Terminal, `git clone` your repository and `cd` into it:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-clinic
cd quarto-clinic
```

### Create a new branch

Working in a branch means you have your own version of the Quarto Clinic to edit and preview. Later, we'll learn how to contribute your edits to the Main branch of the Clinic by making a "Pull Request".

Navigate into the `quarto-clinic` folder \> click the Git tab \> New Branch, with branch name = your name, to make it easy to identify in following exercises.

*TODO add cmd line*

## Onward!

Now you are ready to start editing! The next chapter describes how to do this in the JupyterHub.
