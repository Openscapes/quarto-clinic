## Troubleshooting

### My changes don't show up in preview

Make sure you've saved your file! There might be a slight delay depending on your JupyterHub setup.

### Quarto render hangs / does not complete

Check the specific notebook, are there any \`---\` throughout to denote line breaks rather than yaml? They might be causing the issue; consider deleting those.

Also check how long the first raw cell is. Are there level-1 headers (`#`)? Try removing them.
