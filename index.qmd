## Welcome

It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [GitHub](http://github.com). This Clinic is an example of a Quarto website --- a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.

The ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project. Quarto is a common place for us to collaborate - across Python and R languages and varied levels of coding expertise, and accessibility and inclusion are centered in the Quarto design.

**To begin**, you should have a GitHub account with access to the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub.

## Purpose, Outcomes, Process ([POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/))

**Purpose:** NASA Openscapes Mentors learn workflows with Quarto and GitHub for contributing to the [NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) or any site or book made with Quarto. An opportunity for Mentors to connect and skill-build together.

**Outcomes:** Mentors build skills and are more equipped and empowered to contribute. This is a new clinic we can reuse and build on.

**Process:** A 1.5-hr clinic that can be used to teach or as self-paced learning. with demo's and hands-on practice to guide folks through contributing to existing Quarto sites & books. Analogous to our GitHub Clinic. The clinic content is contained in this website that is built with Quarto on GitHub; there are no accompanying slide decks.

1.  Quarto Workflow: Use the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub to explore this clinic website and its source repository on GitHub, practice contributing to this site by editing a Quarto file or adding a new Jupyter Notebook and previewing the changes.

2.  GitHub Workflow: Clone the repository for this site, make a branch to work in, edit, commit and push your edits to GitHub, make a pull request, review and merge a pull request, and communicate what you’re doing at each step.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto helps you have your ideas and your code in one place, and present it in a beautiful way.

> Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books, presentations, and more.

Quarto can be used to create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable through your favorite IDE like JupyterHub or RStudio. Creating and editing websites with Quarto can be done without knowing R, Python or HTML, CSS, etc, however, Quarto integrates with these tools so you can make your websites as complex and beautiful as you like as you see examples and reuse and remix from others in the open science community.

[Quarto.org](https://quarto.org) is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!
