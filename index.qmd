## Welcome

This book is an example of a Quarto website that is published via GitHub - these are powerful workflows to create and share your work.

Quarto lets us build websites as a collection of files (`.qmd`, `.ipynb`, `.rmd` and others). Today we'll focus on `.qmd` files, which are plain-text files that work nicely with GitHub workflows.

Quarto enables us to collaborate on documentation and tutorials - across Python and R languages and varied levels of coding expertise. Importantly, it lets us write and share documentation/tutorials using the same tools we teach research teams for reproducible science.

The ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project, so this tutorial will enable you to contribute to that site as well as the [NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) (both made with Quarto+GitHub.)

## Our Plan today

We will learn workflows with Quarto and GitHub for contributing to open source documentation. We'll cover contributing in 2 parts:

**Part 1. Quarto Workflow:** Use the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub as an editor: we will contribute to this Quarto site by editing a `.qmd` file and previewing the changes.

**Part 2. GitHub Workflow:** Clone the repository for this site, make a branch to work in, commit and push your edits to GitHub, make a pull request, review and merge a pull request, and communicate what youâ€™re doing at each step.

This requires some setup. We'll do this first, and discuss more as we go.

## Prerequisites

**To begin**, you should have a GitHub account with access to the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub.
