## Welcome

It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [GitHub](http://github.com). This Clinic is an example of a Quarto website --- a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books, presentations, and more.

The ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project. Quarto is a common place for us to collaborate - across Python and R languages and varied levels of coding expertise, and accessibility and inclusion are centered in the Quarto design.

**To begin**, you should have a GitHub account with access to the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub.

## Our Plan today

We will learn workflows with Quarto and GitHub for contributing to open source documentation - like the [NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/).

This is a 1.5-hr clinic that has demos and time for hands-on practice in breakout rooms.

**Part 1. Quarto Workflow:** Use the 2i2c Openscapes JupyterHub to explore this clinic website and its source repository on GitHub, practice contributing to this site by editing a Quarto file or adding a new Jupyter Notebook and previewing the changes.

**Part 2. GitHub Workflow:** Clone the repository for this site, make a branch to work in, edit, commit and push your edits to GitHub, make a pull request, review and merge a pull request, and communicate what youâ€™re doing at each step.

This requires some setup. We'll do this first, and discuss more as we go.
