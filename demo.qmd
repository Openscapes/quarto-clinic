title: "`demo.qmd` file for practice"
---

This `demo.qmd` file has [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)-formatted text, examples for adding headers, hyperlinks, and inserting images with alt-text.

-   Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize on the side of the page. In a Quarto site, headers let you share a specific section of a page by clicking on a header and copying the URL.
-   Hyperlinking lets us cite our sources and inspirations and give credit.

We can all practice Markdown in this Quarto file. Make an edit, preview how it will look in the site (`quarto preview`), edit, repeat.

Only make changes to the section below under *your* name header (to prevent conflicts with other people's edits)

## Ideas for contributions

#### Headers

We can make headers using `## Name`, `### Name`, etc. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize your content. You can share a specific subsection of a page by copying its URL.

#### Hyperlinks

We can make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you name the hyperlink in `[]` and put the URL in `()`. For example, here's a link to [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Hyperlinking lets us cite and give credit to our sources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook ([Barrett et al.](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/)).

#### Images

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. The `[]` contain the caption (optional) and `()` contain the path to the image file.

Additional attributes like image size, alt text, and linking the image to a URL, are set inside `{}` in this example:

`![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="35%"}`

![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="35%"}
