title: "`.qmd` file for practice"
---

This `demo.qmd` file has [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)-formatted text, examples for adding headers, hyperlinks, and inserting images with alt-text, and a Python code chunk.

-   Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize on the side of the page. In a Quarto site, headers let you share a specific section of a page by clicking on a header and copying the URL.
-   Hyperlinking lets us cite our sources and inspirations and give credit.
-   Python code in a `.qmd` file will be executed automatically.

We can all practice Markdown in this Quarto file. Make an edit, preview how it will look in the site (`quarto preview`), edit, repeat.

Only make changes to the section below under *your* name header (to prevent conflicts with other people's edits)

## Ideas for contributions

#### Headers

We can make headers using `## Name`, `### Name`, etc. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize your content. You can share a specific subsection of a page by copying its URL.

#### Hyperlinks

We can make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you name the hyperlink in `[]` and put the URL in `()`. For example, here's a link to [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Hyperlinking lets us cite and give credit to our sources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook ([Barrett et al.](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/)).

#### Images

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. The `[]` contain the caption (optional) and `()` contain the path to the image file.

Additional attributes like image size, alt text, and linking the image to a URL, are set inside `{}` in this example:

`![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="35%"}`

![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="35%"}

#### Code

When you **Render**, a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

*TODO: day before clinic, make this Python code (don't add screenshot - fewer files to for folks to get distracted with, lighter weight repo)*

```{python}
2 * 2
```

You can add options to executable code. The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
