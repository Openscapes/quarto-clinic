title: Transition from RMarkdown
---

You may already have workflows in RMarkdown and are interested in transitioning to Quarto. 

There's no hurry to migrate to Quarto. Keep using Rmarkdown and when you're ready the migration will be fine.

Here are some notes as we migrate RMarkdown sites. 

*TODO: translating R code chunks*

## Bookdown to quarto

create `_quarto.yml`

Project options > build tools > project build tools > none

Reload project

Don't need to delete anything immediately, but look at `output.yml`, purge afterbody. 

Bookdown might be most challenging because of citations and cross-refs but still not that hard

### GitHub actions

R

## Distill to quarto

We transitioned our [events site](https://openscapes.org/events) from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view [before](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/tree/13f95f507629eba5e6ed721d1902258dcbc421e6) and [after](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/tree/237acd5144d810cb5465cc5616ee453f2e261fbc)). We followed excellent notes and examples from [Nick Tierney](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/) and [Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/). 

After we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed "Build website" rather then "Render Website" and "Preview Website", and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the `.Rproj` file. Clicking on the `.Rproj` file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options > Build Tools > Project Build Tools > **None**.

Looking at files [`/posts/_metadata.yml`](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/blob/main/posts/_metadata.yml) and [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/blob/main/_quarto.yml) helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added `citation: true` to [`/posts/_metadata.yml`](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/blob/main/posts/_metadata.yml) and in [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/blob/main/_quarto.yml) under the `website` key we set `site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events`. We deleted `footer.html` used with distill because footer is now defined in `quarto.yml`.

### Publishing notes

> **Background**: Our distill site had been set up to output to a `docs` folder, and had GitHub Settings > Pages set to look there rather `gh-pages` branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We've inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in `_quarto.yml`: [`output-dir: docs`](https://github.com/Openscapes/events/blob/237acd5144d810cb5465cc5616ee453f2e261fbc/_quarto.yml#L3). However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -

**Don't specify `output-dir` in `_quarto.yml`**. The output directory default is `_site/`, which is what we'd like.

If you currently have a `docs/` folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.

**Update `.gitignore` to ignore `_site/`**. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file: 

```{.bash}
/.quarto/
*_cache/
_site/
```

**Push these changes, merge into main.**

**On GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing**

Follow instructions from the [explore and setup chapter](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/explore.html#set-up-github-publishing). 

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Action fails, says you need RMarkdown but you don't have R code!

And you changed all .Rmds to .qmds!

You likely have a few `setup` code chunks from RMarkdown, that look like this:

`{r setup, include=FALSE}`

`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`

You can find them by opening each of your files and having a look, or use GitHub's search for the keyword `knitr`
