## Contribute your updates using GitHub

*TODO: refine this list of steps, keep the list here so folks know what's coming*

*TODO: use text and some screenshot styles from 2021 Cloud Hackathon [Tracking changes section](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/00_Setup.html#step-5.-tracking-changes-optional)*

GitHub commit, push, (move to GitHub.com….) pull request, review PRs, merge

1.  Good commit messages

2.  Push to GitHub then move to GitHub.com, screenshot yellow banner to compare and make a pull request

3.  Not finished proposing your updates? Can make Draft PR at the start so folks can see your thinking. Set Ready for Review when ready. Request specific reviewer(s). 

4.  Condense/ adapt [Review a pull request](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/workflow.html#review-a-pull-request) from Cookbook; note using “suggesting” and commenting, “Start your Review” instead of adding single comments (fewer notifications)

5.  **Demo**: have someone commit and push, PR, tag Stef as reviewer. Screenshare the above steps to review. That person screenshares to commit suggested edits, merge their PR.

6.  **Task**: people pair up to review each other’s PRs.

In the Hub, in our own branch of the Quarto Clinic repo, we have made one or more edits to the Clinic files, committed those updates, and pushed those commit(s) to GitHub. How do our suggested contributions get incorporated into the main Quarto Clinic repo and website?

## Make a Pull Request

After pushing your edits, go to <https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-clinic/> and you will see a yellow banner inviting you to make a pull request to add your edits to the Clinic repo.
