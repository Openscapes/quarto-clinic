In this section we'll practice two workflows: [Part 1: Edit a Quarto site](part1-quarto.qmd), and [Part 2: Contribute via GitHub](part2-github.qmd). We include a basic workflow for each here, so you can come back to these for a reminder.

## Workflow to edit a Quarto site source

1.  Preview the site
2.  Make changes to files, save, preview
3.  Update `_quarto.yml` file to have new content appear in the site's nav bar.
4.  

## Workflow to contribute via GitHub

1.  Inspect the differences your edits will introduce
2.  "Stage" your changes
3.  Commit your changes with a helpful "Commit message"
4.  "Push" to GitHub
5.  Go to the Clinic repo source on GitHub, in your browser
6.  Make a "Pull Request" and tag a reviewer
7.  Reviewer responds by commenting, making suggested commits, and submitting their review
8.  Author responds to review and "merges" their Pull Request
9.  A GitHub Action automatically publishes the updates in the live siteDiff, Stage, Commit, and Push your edits to GitHub

## Let's try these workflows!
