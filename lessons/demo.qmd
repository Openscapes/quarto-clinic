title: "`demo.qmd` aka Quarto Practice"
---

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.

This `demo.qmd` file has Markdown-formatted text, examples for adding hyperlinks and inserting images with alt-text, and a Python code chunk.

*TODO: edit this file to contain the content listed below*

### Edit and preview a demo.qmd file

-   Headers. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize on the side of the page. They let you share a specific section of a page by copying the URL
-   hyperlink something (cite the Cookbook and hyperlink it). Hyperlinking is done like this; lets you cite and give credit
-   inspect this image with alt-txt
-   Python code. manage echo, run

## Task: Edit a `.qmd` page

*TODO: Edit down to what we need, duplicated under each name header*

::: callout-note
Only make changes to the section under your name header (to prevent conflicts at a later stage)
:::

Now let's practice Markdown and commit an edit to this file.

### Stefanie

Fix this tpyo.

### Julie

Fix this tpyo.

### Andy

Fix this tpyo.

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

### We can make headers using `### Name`.

We can make hyperlinks in [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) using the `[]()` pattern: you name hyperlink in `[]` and put the URL in `()`. For example:

[This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. For example:

[![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="250"}](https://openscapes.org/)

*Note how we can add alt text for the image, manage the image size, and link the image to a URL*

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

You can add options to executable code like this

TODO: day before clinic, make this Python code (don't add screenshot - fewer files to for folks to get distracted with, lighter weight repo)

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Your turn! Change or add something in this file under your Name header and save the file.
