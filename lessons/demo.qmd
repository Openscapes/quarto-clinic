title: "`demo.qmd` Quarto Practice"
---

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.

This `demo.qmd` file has Markdown-formatted text, examples for adding hyperlinks and inserting images with alt-text, and a Python code chunk.

-   Headers. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize on the side of the page. They let you share a specific section of a page by copying the URL
-   hyperlink something (cite the Cookbook and hyperlink it). Hyperlinking is done like this; lets you cite and give credit
-   inspect this image with alt-txt
-   Python code. manage echo, run

Stef will demo then it's your turn.

## Task 1a: Edit a `.qmd` page

*TODO: Edit down to what we need, duplicated under each name header*

::: callout-note
Only make changes to the section under your name header (to prevent conflicts at a later stage)
:::

Now let's practice Markdown in this Quarto file and commit an edit to this file. Open the `demo.qmd`

Make an edit, preview, edit etc

### Stefanie

Your first edit? Fix this tpyo.

#### **Headers**

We can make headers using `## Name`, `### Name`, etc. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize your content. You can share a specific subsection of a page by copying its URL.

#### **Hyperlinks**

We can make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you name the hyperlink in `[]` and put the URL in `()`. For example, here's a link to [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Hyperlinking lets us cite and give credit to our sources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook ([Barrett et al.](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/)).

#### **Images**

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. The `[]` contain the caption and `()` contain the path to the image file. Other attributes like image size, alt text, and a hyperlink, are also set in this example:

[![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="150"}](https://openscapes.org/)

#### **Code**

When you **Render**, a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

*TODO: day before clinic, make this Python code (don't add screenshot - fewer files to for folks to get distracted with, lighter weight repo)*

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

You can add options to executable code. The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Julie

Fix this tpyo.

*TODO: copy activities text under each participant heading when it's settled*

### Andy

Fix this typo.

Also adding another line.

## Your turn!

Change or add something to this file under your Name header and save the file.
