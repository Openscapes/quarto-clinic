title: "`demo.qmd` Quarto Practice"
---

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.

This `demo.qmd` file has Markdown-formatted text, examples for adding headers, hyperlinks, and inserting images with alt-text, and a Python code chunk.

Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize on the side of the page. In a Quarto site, headers let you share a specific section of a page by clicking on a header and copying the URL.

Hyperlinking lets us cite our sources and inspirations and give credit.

Python code in a `.qmd` file will be executed automatically. *TODO: draft manage echo, run*

## Task 1a: Edit a `.qmd` page

We can all practice Markdown in this Quarto file. Make an edit, preview how it will look in the site (quarto preview), edit, repeat.

#### **Headers**

We can make headers using `## Name`, `### Name`, etc. Headers are powerful in Quarto because they let you organize your content. You can share a specific subsection of a page by copying its URL.

#### **Hyperlinks**

We can make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you name the hyperlink in `[]` and put the URL in `()`. For example, here's a link to [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Hyperlinking lets us cite and give credit to our sources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook ([Barrett et al.](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/)).

#### **Images**

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. The `[]` contain the caption (optional) and `()` contain the path to the image file.

![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){width="150"}

Additional attributes like image size, alt text, and linking the image to a URL, are set inside `{}` in this example:

[![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt="Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots" width="150"}](https://openscapes.org/)

#### **Code**

When you **Render**, a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

*TODO: day before clinic, make this Python code (don't add screenshot - fewer files to for folks to get distracted with, lighter weight repo)*

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

You can add options to executable code. The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Fix this tpyo.

*TODO: copy activities text under each participant heading when it's settled*

### Andy

Fix this tpyo.

## Your turn!

Change or add something to this file under your Name header and save the file.
