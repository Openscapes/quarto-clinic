## Login to 2i2c JupyterHub

Go to the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud> \> log in with your GitHub Account \> select the Python server.

[![Login page for the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub, "the Hub"](images/jupyterhub-2i2c-login.png)](https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/){width="40%"}

Click the orange Start button with defaults for Python and resource allocation.

It takes a few minutes for the Hub to load. Please be patient!

## Clone `quarto-clinic` repo

After our Hub server has loaded, we'll clone the Quarto Clinic repository into the Hub. We'll do this using a clickable plugin; you could also do this from the Terminal if you prefer.

In the Hub, use the Git tab to Clone the repo.

## Create a branch

Next, we'll create a branch in git/GitHub. Working in a branch means you have your own version of the Quarto Clinic to edit and preview.

Branches are like parallel universes where you can safely make changes to source materials without disturbing the original. It is good practice to using branches for small, discrete additions that you will then contribute back to the main branch. In Clinic Part 2, we'll learn how to contribute your edits to the Main branch of the Clinic by making a "Pull Request" on GitHub.

First, set `quarto-clinic` as your working directory. In the Terminal type `cd quarto-clinic`. (You may need to click on the folder icon at the top-left of the side nav bar to return to the Terminal.)

Next, click the Git plugin tab. Click New Branch (blue rectangle) and enter a new branch name, let's write *your name*, to make it easy to identify your work in the exercises that follow.

## Set up our Git credentials

*TODO: do we need to do [Step 5.1. Configure Git (`git config`)](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/00_Setup.html#step-5.1.-configure-git-git-config)? (but ignore the push file part). Clarify the following text to say see the orange dot. click it to be prompted*

When you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com. In this case we have created a new branch in the Hub and it does not yet exist on GitHub.

We'll follow the instructions in the 2021 Cloud Hackathon to [Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/00_Setup.html#step-5.6.-setup-pat).

## Onward!

Since we have each set up our own GitHub clone with our unique branch of this Quarto Clinic website in the Hub, now we are ready to start editing! The next chapter describes how to do this in the JupyterHub.
