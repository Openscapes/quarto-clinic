## Workflow to edit a Quarto website source

1.  Preview the website (`quarto preview`)
2.  Make changes to files 
3.  Save and preview how changes are automatically updated!

## Demo: Edit and preview a demo.qmd file
I will demonstrate this with the `demo.qmd` file: watch me and then you will all have a chance to do this yourself.

### Preview the website (aka Quarto preview)

Let's start off by previewing our quarto site locally. In Terminal, in the `quarto-clinic` folder, type `quarto preview`, which will provide a URL with a preview of our site!

``` bash
quarto preview
# Preparing to preview
# Watching files for changes
# Browse at https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/user/jules32/proxy/4593/
```

Open this URL in a browser window and arrange your Hub and website preview windows so you can see them both. I make a bit more space in Jupyter by collapsing the left file menu by clicking on the file icon at the top of the left sidebar.

## Make changes to files (aka the website content)

**Open [`demo.qmd`](demo.qmd) file using the Editor, not as a Notebook file.** Suggestions for things to try, and how to format things are in the file.

I will fix a small typo. 

### Save and preview automagically updates!

When we save changes, our preview window will refresh automatically and display our changes! If it does not, you can also refresh the page manually.

This is powerful to be able to see live changes in the preview as we edit in our `.qmd` files. 

## Your turn 

In your breakout room: 

- In terminal, `cd quarto-clinic` and then `quarto preview`
- Open `demo.qmd` file
- Find the header with your name, edit in that section. Ideas at the top of the file.
- Save, `quarto preview`
- Repeat!

## Regroup discussion topics

- When adding new files, update `_quarto.yml` file as needed to have new content appear in the site's nav bar. (see https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/explore.html)
