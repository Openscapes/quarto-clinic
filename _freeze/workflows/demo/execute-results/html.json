You can embed code like this:\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\nTODO: day before clinic, make this Python code (don't add screenshot - fewer files to for folks to get distracted with, lighter weight repo)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n\n## Task: Edit a `.qmd` page\n\nTODO: Edit down to what we need. \n\nNow let's practice Markdown and commit an edit to this file.\n\nThis file is written in Markdown, which formats text on the web. To see the Markdown that results in the following formatting, click the pencil icon to edit, or click 'Raw' to inspect it. For example, with Markdown:\n\nWe can make words **bold** or *italic*.\n\n### We can make headers.\n\nWe can make lists â€“ *note that lists need an empty line before list items!*\n\n1.  bananas\n2.  tamales\n3.  cakes\n\nWe can make hyperlinks in [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) using the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. For example:\n\n> [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).\n\nWe can make an indented quote block with the `>` symbol, as in the example above.\n\nWe can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. For example:\n\n[![The Openscapes logo](/images/openscapes_hex.png){fig-alt=\"Openscapes logo. A hexagonal shape with orange border, yellow background, the word openscapes in orange above a cartoon evoking a landscape of data plots\" width=\"250\"}](https://openscapes.org/)\n\n*Note how we can add alt text for the image, manage the image size, and link the image to a URL* \n\nYour turn! Change or add something in Markdown and make another commit: write a human-readable commit message, and press the green button to commit changes.\n\n",
